Use Case Chosen:

The chosen use case is to summarize YouTube videos automatically by extracting key ideas and providing a structured summary, which helps viewers quickly grasp the main points without watching the entire video.
Problem/Idea:

    Problem: With the vast amount of content on YouTube, watching long videos to extract important information can be time-consuming. Sometimes, viewers only want a brief overview or key points from the video rather than sitting through the entire length. The challenge is creating an efficient system that can automatically transcribe and summarize the content.

    Idea: The idea is to create an AI-powered tool that takes a YouTube video URL, extracts the audio, transcribes it, and then generates a concise summary. This system should divide the content into manageable chunks, summarize them, and present the user with key points in a structured format (JSON).

How You Solve It with Gen AI:

    Generative AI (especially using models like Whisper for transcription and Transformers for summarization) is used to:

        Transcribe Audio: The audio from the YouTube video is extracted and transcribed into text using Whisper, a speech-to-text model. This enables us to convert spoken content into a textual form.

        Summarization: After the transcription, the text is broken into smaller chunks. Each chunk is then passed to a Transformer-based model (like BART, T5, or GPT) to summarize it into concise and coherent ideas.

        Structured Output: The summaries and the original transcript are returned in a structured JSON format, making it easier for users or other systems to access the information.

This process allows the user to quickly grasp the important ideas from a video, saving time and effort while leveraging Generative AI to automate the tasks of transcription and summarization.
